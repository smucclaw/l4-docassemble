#+TITLE: l4-docassemble-readme

This is a docker image meant for use in testing l4-transpiled docassemble interviews.


** Requirements
- Docker

** Build instructions
1) Clone this directory
2) Run the following command:

   #+begin_src bash
docker build -t l4-da .
   #+end_src

   This installs a local image of l4-da within your docker.

#+begin_src bash
docker run -d -p 80:80 -p 443:443 --stop-timeout 600 l4-da
#+end_src

- When it succeeds, you should see a hash output from STDOUT
- Wait 2 minutes for it to initialize, then open your web-browser of choice & connect to localhost
- default loging details are "admin@admin.com" & "password"


** Testing

The docker image consists of the original docassemble environment written by jhpyle, with an sCASP reasoner as well as some docassemble packages installed.

To test the docassemble packages:
    - docassemble-datatypes
      1) Go to http://localhost/interview?i=docassemble.datatypes:datatypes_test.yml
      2) The demonstration interview should work without errors

    - docassemble-scasp
      1) Go to http://localhost/interview?i=docassemble.scasp:DAScasp_test.yml
      2) You should see an answer that Socrates is mortal, together with reasons
